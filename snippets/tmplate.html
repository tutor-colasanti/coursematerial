    <h3>Educational website</h3>

    <h3>Editor</h3>
    <p>The choice of an editor or integrated development environment is up to you. The editor I recommend is <a class="links" href="https://atom.io//">ATOM</a>. ATOM is a highly customisable editor with many community sourced packages. The  <a class="links" href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server">atom-live-server </a>package allows local web development without having to install your own local web server. </p>

    <h3>Web publishing</h3>
    <p>We will use the version control hosting web site <a class="links" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> to publish our webpages. See tutorial 1 for a guide on how to set up your project web page. GitHub is also responsible for the ATOM editor so is tightly integrated with it.</p>
